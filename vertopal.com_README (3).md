Welcome to the **Titanic Survival Prediction** project! This repository uses the iconic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using a neural network built with TensorFlow. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualizations, all in a Jupyter Notebook. Perfect for machine learning beginners! 🌟

## 📋 Project Overview
This project tackles the classic Titanic survival prediction problem. Using features like passenger class, age, sex, and fare, we preprocess the data, train a neural network, and evaluate its performance. The code is written in Python and leverages pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. 📊

Dataset: [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) (loaded via GitHub raw URL).

## ✨ Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean missing values, encode categorical features (Sex, Embarked), and scale numerical data. 🧹
- **Neural Network**: A Keras-based feedforward model for binary classification (survived or not). 🧠
- **Visualizations**: Explore data trends and model performance with matplotlib plots. 📈
- **GPU Support**: Optimized for Google Colab with T4 GPU acceleration. ⚡

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-predictor.git
   cd titanic-survival-predictor
```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ``` bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
    ```

    Or use a `requirements.txt`:

    ``` bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Project

1.  Open `Titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2.  Execute the cells to:
    -   Load and preprocess the Titanic dataset.
    -   Train the neural network model.
    -   Visualize results (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix).
3.  Expected output: Model achieves \~80-82% accuracy on validation
    data. 🎯

## 🧠 Model Details

-   **Architecture**:
    -   Input: Features (Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, etc.) after
        preprocessing.
    -   Hidden Layers: 2 dense layers (32 and 16 neurons, ReLU
        activation).
    -   Output: Sigmoid layer for binary classification (survival
        probability).
-   **Training**: Uses Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
-   **Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve visualized
    in the notebook.

## 📊 Results

-   **Validation Accuracy**: \~82%.
-   **Visualizations**: Includes plots for survival rates by class, age,
    etc.
-   **Example Plot**: (Replace with actual plot URL if hosted)
