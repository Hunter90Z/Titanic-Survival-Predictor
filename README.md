to the **Titanic Survival Predictor** project! 🌊 This Jupyter
Notebook-based machine learning model dives into the historic Titanic
dataset to predict passenger survival using neural networks. Whether
you're a data science newbie or a seasoned sailor in ML waters, this
project is your ticket to exploring predictive modeling with a dash of
history! 📜

## Overview 📊

The Titanic disaster of 1912 is one of history's most infamous events.
In this project, we use the famous Titanic dataset to build a deep
learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived based on
features like age, sex, class, and more.

-   **Goal**: Predict survival (0 = Did not survive 😢, 1 = Survived 🎉)
    using a neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras.
-   **Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle's Titanic challenge (via GitHub raw
    URL).
-   **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn,
    TensorFlow.
-   **Why Fun?**: It's a classic ML problem with real-world data
    insights -- who survived and why? 🚀

## Features ✨

-   **Data Loading & Exploration**: Load the Titanic dataset and peek
    into its structure 🔍.
-   **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical
    variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked), and scale features for optimal
    model performance 📈.
-   **Neural Network Model**: Build and train a TensorFlow/Keras model
    to predict survival 🧠.
-   **Visualization**: Plot key insights using Matplotlib to understand
    data distributions 📊.
-   **Scalable Workflow**: Easily adaptable for further experimentation
    or hyperparameter tuning ⚙️.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

-   Python 3.12+ 🐍
-   Jupyter Notebook 📓
-   Libraries: Install via `pip install -r requirements.txt` or
    manually:
    -   `pandas`
    -   `numpy`
    -   `matplotlib`
    -   `scikit-learn`
    -   `tensorflow`

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/shervinnd/titanic-survival-predictor.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ``` bash
    cd titanic-survival-predictor
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ``` bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ``` bash
    jupyter notebook Titanic.ipynb
    ```

### Dataset

The dataset is sourced directly from:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv

It includes features like:

-   `PassengerId`, `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`,
    `Fare`, `Embarked`
-   Preprocessing steps handle missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`) and
    drop irrelevant columns (`Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`).

## Usage 🛠️

1.  Open `Titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2.  Run the cells sequentially to:
    -   Load and preprocess the data 🧹.
    -   Build and train the neural network 🧠.
    -   Evaluate model performance 📊.
3.  Experiment with hyperparameters or feature engineering to improve
    accuracy 🚧.

## Project Structure 📂

-   `Titanic.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with data processing, model
    training, and evaluation.
